    <h1>Python Operators</h1>

    <h3>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</h3>

    <h2>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</h2>

    <h3>

       #- Arithmetic operators<br>

 

       #-  Assignment operators<br>

 

       #-  Comparison operators<br>

 

       #-  Logical operators<br>

 

       #- Identity operators<br>

 

       #-  Membership operators<br>

 

       #-  Bitwise operators<br><br>

    </h3>

    <!-- /*3rd pages*/ -->

<h2>Python Conditions and If statements</h2>

<h3>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:<br>

* Equals: a == b<br>

* Not Equals: a != b<br>

* Less than: a < b<br>

* Less than or equal to: a <= b<br>

* Greater than: a > b<br>

* Greater than or equal to: a >= b<br>

</h3>

<h2>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.<br><br>

( 1 ) Elif</h2>

<h3>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</h3>

<h2>( 2 ) Else</h2>

<h3>The else keyword catches anything which isnot caught by the preceding conditions.</h3>



<h2>Python Loops</h2>

<h3>Python has two primitive loop commands:<br><br>

( 1 ) while loops<br>

( 2 ) for loops<br>

<h2>The while Loop<h2>

<h3>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:<br><br>

The continue Statement<br>

With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:</h3>

<h2>Python For Loops<h2>

<h3>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

 

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages,

and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.<br>

 

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set et

The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</h3>

 


<h1>What is an Array?<h1>

    <h3>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

        If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

 

        However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

        The solution is an array!<br>

 

        An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

</h3>

<h1>Python Classes/Objects:</h1>

    <h3>Python is an object oriented programming language.

    Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

 

     A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</h3>

 

 <h2>Create a Class<h2>

 

    <h3>To create a class, use the keyword class:</h3>

<h2>Create Object<h2>

    <h3>Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:<h3>

<h1>Python Inheritance</h1>

<h3>

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

 

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

 

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.</h3>


 

<h1>Python Iterators</h1>

 

<h3>An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.

 

An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.

 

Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol,which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().</h3>
